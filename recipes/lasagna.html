  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Lasagna, also known as <strong><em>lasagne</em></strong> is a type of pasta, possibly one of the oldest types,[2] made in very wide, flat sheets. The same-named Italian dish is made of stacked layers of lasagna alternating with fillings such as ragù (ground meats and tomato sauce), béchamel sauce, vegetables, cheeses (which may include ricotta, mozzarella and Parmesan), and seasonings and spices.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 pound sweet italian sausage</li>
    <li>3/4 pound lean ground beef</li>
    <li>1/2 cup minced onion</li>
    <li>2 cloves, garlic, crushed</li>
    <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
    <li>2(6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
    <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
    <li>1/2 cup water</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons with sugar</li>
    <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>
    <li>1 1/2 teaspoon salt, divided, or to taste</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon italian seasoning</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
    <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
    <li>1 egg </li>
    <li>3/4 pund mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
    <li>3/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Gather all your ingredients.</li>
    <li>Cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic in a Dutch oven over medium heat until well browned.</li>
    <li>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water. Season with sugar, 2 tablespoons parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, italian seasoning, fennel seeds, and pepper. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
    <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water.</li>
    <li>In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining 2 tablespoons parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
    <li>To assemble, speed 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrage 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce, overlaping slightly. Spread with 1/2 of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with of the mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. </li>
    <li>Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil; to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 25 minutes.</li>
    <li>Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving. \n</li>
